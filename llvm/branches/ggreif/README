At the moment there are branched for two projects
here. Both are experimental. Use with caution,
expect bugs ;-)

Questions? <mailto:ggreif@gmail.com>

1) Parallel "make check".
Modelled after the successful clang "make test -jX" experiment, I am
now bold enough to sink my teeth into the LLVM test suite.
I have a prototype implementation, along the same lines, ready.

BRANCH NAME: TBD

2) <class Use> size reduction.
After some conversation with Chris I think we are ready for a
16 -> 12 byte size reduction of the Use class. There are some
collateral improvements too. This project is in its conceptual phase.

BRANCH NAME: use-diet
USAGE:
  cd llvm
  svn switch http(s)://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/branches/ggreif/use-diet .
