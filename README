At the moment there are branched for two projects
here. Both are experimental. Use with caution,
expect bugs ;-)

1) Parallel "make check".
Modelled after the successful clang "make test -jX" experiment, I am
now bold enough to sink my teeth into the LLVM test suite.
I have a prototype implementation, along the same lines, ready.

BRANCH NAME: parallelized-test
USAGE:
  cd llvm/test
  svn switch http(s)://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/branches/ggreif/parallelized-test .

 alternatively you can only switch the two affected files:
  cd llvm/test
  svn switch http(s)://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/branches/ggreif/parallelized-test/Makefile Makefile
  svn switch http(s)://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/branches/ggreif/parallelized-test/lib/llvm.exp lib/llvm.exp

2) <class Use> size reduction.
After some conversation with Chris I think we are ready for a
16 -> 12 byte size reduction of the Use class. There are some
collateral improvements too. This project is in its very early
implementation phase.

SYNOPSIS:
There will be six waves until this project can be closed. A
wave is defined as a point in the implementation that is consistent,
correct and mergable to trunk. Each wave ends with a code review
and the necessary rework (which may require a new review, etc.).
Whether a merge actually takes place will be decided on a
case-by-case basis.

WAVE1: Finalize the design, document it, adapt memory allocation for Users.
       Caveats: 'operator new' and 'operator delete' must match.

WAVE2: Remove Use objects that are embedded in Users. 'operator new' now
       performs real work. Create wrappers to destructor and 'operator delete'
       that do the right thing (where needed).

WAVE3: Flip indexing order of Uses. This involves changing the iterators.

WAVE4: Remove User* from Use, introducing surrogate getters. Embedded and
       out-of-object representations being considered.

WAVE5: Stylistic and performance tweaks. Valgrind testing.

WAVE6: Measurements, finishing touches.

BRANCH NAME: use-diet
USAGE:
  cd llvm
  svn switch http(s)://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/branches/ggreif/use-diet .
